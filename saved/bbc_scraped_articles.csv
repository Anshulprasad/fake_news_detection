Watch: Thousands attend Leo XIV's inauguration Mass

Zelensky, US Vice President JD Vance and the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio were among dignitaries in attendance.

The Pope spoke to a crowd of thousands in St Peter's Square to warn against marginalisation of the poor and autocracy.

The new Catholic leader highlighted his concerns about the war in Ukraine in his prayer at the end of the service, saying ""the martyred Ukraine is waiting for negotiations for a just and lasting peace to finally happen"".

Pope Leo XIV is to meet the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, the Vatican has said after his inauguration Mass.

Thousands of pilgrims stood in reverence as the pope received the symbols of office, blessed the people and issued a strong call for unity.

He also said he would seek to govern ""without ever yielding to the temptation to be an autocrat"".

He used his Mass to criticise ""hatred, violence, prejudice, the fear of difference, and an economic paradigm that exploits the Earth's resources and marginalises the poorest"".

The pontiff was seen shaking hands with Zelensky, as well as other dignitaries.

Before the Mass, there were cheers from the crowd when the pontiff appeared in his popemobile as it drove around St Peter's Square and down Via della Conciliazione to the river Tiber and back.

There was a strong sense of excitement in the square. Michelle, from Germany, told the BBC she ""came on purpose to see the Pope"".

""I arrived yesterday in the morning and I'm leaving in a few hours, so I don't have much time. It's very crazy because there's so many people. I wanted to see the Pope.""

Many of the tens of thousands attending were Catholics, but tourists also came to be part of the historic occasion.

Joe from Missouri in the United States said: ""We're on vacation, but it's great timing. We're here to see the Pope's inaugural mass. It's very special. I'm glad we came early.""

He said he was ""extra proud"" to see the first Pope from the United States. ""That was a surprise. He's gonna be a wonderful Pope. I am not Catholic, but I grew up Catholic, but this is just inspiring no matter what denomination of Christian you are.""

Also in the crowds was Pia, from Chile, a professor of philosophy at a the Pontifical University of the Holy Cross in Rome. She told the BBC she felt there was ""a new hope in the church"".

Pia said that among the Pope's first words when he was elected was ""Let the peace be with you"", the words of Jesus. And then he said ""don't be afraid"".

""He knows what the world and the church needs. A church that is preaching hope, preaching peace. I think many people are waiting for that,"" she said.

The Pope's official inauguration followed the Mass, with a pallium garment - a white woolen band - placed on the pope's shoulders, and fixed in place with three pins to represent the nails on the cross.

Cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle of the Philippines then placed on the pope's finger the Ring of the Fisherman, a symbol of the papacy which bears an image of St Peter.

Pope Leo then took the book of the gospels to bless the people.",,

BBC / Twenty Twenty Productions Ltd Nicole went to therapy because she has a fear of driving

Nicole enters the therapist's room and clutches what she calls her hugging pillow. She admits to being nervous about sitting down with a stranger to discuss her mental health. She is 31, lives in London and works as chiropractic assistant. She suffers from anxiety when she drives. ""There are so many things that so quickly go through my head,"" she says. ""How far away is it? What is the route? I somehow forget how to drive."" She suffers from panic attacks and her fear of driving means she is constantly cancelling plans. But, over the course of six sessions with psychotherapist Owen O'Kane, it becomes clear her problems are much deeper than just a fear of driving.

Digging around in the mind

Every week, one in six of the UK population experience mental health problems such as depression and anxiety and every year more than 1.2 million people seek help from the NHS talking therapies service, with many more paying for support privately. This form of therapy is most commonly used for anxiety and depression, but can also help with a range of other problems, including body image dysmorphia, obsessive compulsive disorder and post traumatic stress disorder. It does not work for everyone: research suggests one-third of people do not benefit. The BBC has followed 12 people, featured in the series Change Your Mind, Change Your Life, who each received six support sessions from therapists. The therapists have used a combination of different talking therapy approaches, including cognitive behavioural therapy which focuses on changing the way we think and behave, alongside other techniques to improve relationships and process trauma. What it reveals is striking: How understanding and learning to manage the mind has the power to transform lives.

BBC / Twenty Twenty Productions Ltd Owen O'Kane says being a therapist is a bit like being a detective

""You're not stuck with the brain you've got,"" says Owen O'Kane, who has worked in the field for 25 years. He describes his job as like detective work: ""People come with what seems to be a reasonable story, but the interesting thing is that very often the story and emotions don't match. I guess what we are doing is digging around a little bit.""

'I completely hated myself'

Over their sessions, Owen digs deeper into Nicole's anxiety. At one point she weeps. She admits in the past she has ""completely hated"" herself. She worries about what people think of her and is socially anxious: ""I don't feel good enough to be there. I might say something wrong. I need people to like me."" Owen questions why she feels like this: ""As human beings we like the nice emotions. We like feeling happy, joy, being in love."" but he says some people try to avoid or suppress emotions like fear, dread and sadness, and that can cause anxiety. Instead, he says it is healthier to accept them and accept them as safe. When people get to that point, he says, they start to feel empowered: ""They realise they're not going to be overwhelmed."" Speaking outside the therapy room, Nicole says: ""I'm shocked. He got my number straight away. I would see vulnerability as a negative thing, but it's not."" Asked to describe herself she uses words such as kind, thoughtful, determined and enthusiastic: ""I am not a bad person,"" she tells Owen. She says she has learned a lot: ""Most importantly I found I wasn't being kind to myself. That was really eye-opening."" Owen says this is typical of many people he treats: ""When people get to these crossroads, when they wake up and realise what they are doing, that's a gold dust moment for me.""

'I had stroke in my early 30s'

James likewise learned to think about himself differently thanks to therapy. A 39-year-old father-of-one who works in finance, he struggles with anxiety and, in particular, worries about making mistakes at work. That fear is so debilitating he doesn't make it to work sometimes. He has been supported by Prof Steve Peters, a psychiatrist who explains perfectionism is at the root of his problems: ""If we think it's the end of the world if we make a mistake, it paralyses you."" James was once an athlete, playing semi-professional football and competing in athletics before specialising in the bobsleigh. He was training for trials for the Great Britain team when he had a stroke eight years ago: ""With a flick of a switch, I lost everything,"" he says. ""It made me feel a lesser man."" Now he fears under-performing at work and losing his job.

BBC / Twenty Twenty Productions Ltd James had a stroke in his early 30s

Over the course of the sessions, Prof Peters explains the key is James's belief system. First, he gives some seemingly simple advice: ""Put your feet on the floor, stand up and walk,"" he says. Focusing on the basic task of moving, in James's case moving so he can get to work, enables someone caught up in catastrophic thinking to block out the negative thoughts that stop them doing something. In later sessions, James and Prof Peters explore what could be behind his problems. James tells Prof Peters about his childhood and how his father would criticise him to push him to improve. Prof Peters explains how James believes that to please you cannot make errors and then the devastating stroke he suffered at a young age has triggered an absolute desire for things to never go wrong again. He tells James he needs to make ""peace with himself"" by defining himself not by performance but by values and behaviours. He too asks James to describe himself and James replies he is hard-working, honest, engaging, friendly and as someone who would put others first. Over the course of his sessions, James's way of thinking changes: ""I can look at myself in the mirror and feel my value and my worth,"" he explains.

'My mum died when I was 15'

Anjalee's struggles are somewhat different. They relate to one traumatic event in childhood – her mother died suddenly when she was 15. Now a mother herself, with three children under five, she has struggled emotionally. She has sleepless nights, a tight chest and feels emotionally disconnected. It is worse than any physical pain, says the 34-year-old: ""Becoming a mother has reopening everything I've tried to suppress."" Her first birth was particularly traumatic. She developed sepsis – the condition her mother died from: ""I thought I was not going to survive,"" she says. Her psychotherapist, Julia Samuel, explains to Anjalee she has not been able to process what has happened and, as a result, the trauma has stayed with her. When her mother died, Anjalee was in the middle of exams and had two younger siblings, leaving her without time to grieve.

Illustration by Puneet Kumar In the absence of a verified photograph of PK Rosy, the BBC commissioned an illustrator to create this image

At a time when women's participation in the film industry was frowned upon, a young woman dared to dream differently. In 1920s pre-independence India, PK Rosy became the first female lead in Malayalam-language cinema, in what is now the southern state of Kerala. She starred in a movie called Vigathakumaran, or The Lost Child, in the 1920s. But instead of being remembered as a pioneer, her story was buried - erased by caste discrimination and social backlash. Rosy belonged to a lower-caste community and faced intense criticism for portraying an upper-caste woman in Vigathakumaran. Almost a hundred years later, there is no surviving evidence of Rosy's role. The film's reel was destroyed and the cast and crew have all died. Only a few pictures of the film from a contested press release dated October 1930 survive, along with an unverified black-and-white photo popularised by local newspapers as Rosy's only portrait. Even a Google Doodle celebrating her 120th birthday used an illustration similar to the woman in the photograph. But Rosy's nephew and others who have researched her life told the BBC that they could not conclusively say that it is her in the picture. PK Rosy was born as Rajamma in the early 1900s in the erstwhile kingdom of Travancore, now Kerala. She belonged to a family of grass cutters from the Pulaya community, part of the Dalits, who are at the bottom of India's harsh caste hierarchy and have been historically oppressed. ""People from the Pulaya community were considered slave labour and auctioned off with land,"" says Malavika Binny, a professor of history at Kannur University. ""They were considered the 'lowliest'. They were flogged, raped, tied to trees and set on fire for any so-called transgressions,"" she adds. Despite the dire social challenges, Rosy chose to dream differently.

Illustration by Puneet Kumar A scene in Vigathakumaran showed the hero picking a flower from the heroine's hair and kissing it

She was supported by her uncle, who was a theatre artist himself, and with his help Rosy entered the field of entertainment. ""There are few available facts about Rosy's life, but it is known that she was popular for her performances in local plays,"" says Vinu Abraham, the author of The Lost Heroine, a novel based on Rosy's life. While her acting skills earned admiration, it was rare for a Dalit woman to take up acting at the time. ""She was likely aware of the fact that this was a new arena and making herself visible was important,"" says Prof Binny. She soon became a well-known figure in local theatre circles and her talent caught the eye of director JC Daniel, who was then searching for a lead actor for his film - a character named Sarojini. Daniel was aware of Rosy's caste identity and chose to cast her in the role. ""She was paid five rupees a day for 10 days of filming,"" said Mr Abraham. ""This was a substantial amount of money in the 1920s."" On the day of the film's premiere, Rosy and her family were barred from attending the screening. They were stopped because they were Dalits, Rosy's nephew Biju Govindan says. And so began a chain of events that pushed Rosy out of the public eye and her home. ""The crowd that came to watch the movie were provoked by two things: Rosy playing an upper-caste woman and the hero picking a flower from her hair and kissing it in one scene,"" said Mr Abraham. ""They started throwing rocks at the screen and chased Daniel away,"" he added. There are differing accounts of the extent of the damage to the theatre but what is clear is the toll the incident took on both Rosy and Daniel.

7 hours ago Share Save Paul Pigott BBC News Share Save

Ben Porter Temperate rainforest, seen here in the Vale of Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, is found in areas subject to the influence of the sea

An ""extinction crisis"" is happening in Britain's temperate rainforests where some of the world's rarest mosses, lichens and liverworts are vanishing, ecologists have warned. Also known as Celtic rainforests, temperate rainforests are found primarily along the UK's western coasts. A survey of Welsh rainforests in 2024 found only 22% were in a good condition due to pollution, fragmentation and invasive species. ""When this tree came down, in a flash we lost a species,"" said ecologist Sabine Nouvet about a 500-year-old oak in Eryri National Park, also known as Snowdonia, which fell during Storm Darragh in December.

The tree was home to one of the UK's best known populations of a rare lichen, the loss of which was ""symbolic of the species crisis, the extinction crisis, that we are facing now"", said Ms Nouvet.

Ms Nouvet, a rainforest advisor with PlantLife, a member of the Alliance for Wales' Rainforests, said the fallen tree's bark was once home to more than 60 types of lichen. The rarest was the minuscule rinodina isidioides - its tiny structures, when seen through a hand lens, resemble its common name, skeletal fingers. It lives only on trees at least 300 years old and in conditions found exclusively in the rain-soaked valleys of western Ireland and Britain.

Skeletal fingers lichen attached to other trees with garden netting could help the species to survive, Ms Nouvet says

Temperate rainforests occur on less than 1% of the planet's surface and Wales has internationally important examples of the habitat. The special habitat's twisted branches, dappled light and moss-covered understorey once covered much of the country, but is now only found in isolated areas including the Woodland Trust's Coed Felenrhyd near Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd.

December's storm ""hammered the forests around here"", said Ms Nouvet. She said at least six ancient trees, described as ""grandmothers"" of the forest, were lost in Coed Felenrhyd. The presence of skeletal finger on one of those trees indicated ""that this valley has got clean air, it has ancient forest, that this tree was, for some reason, really old and then we lost it"", she added.

There is hope the skeletal finger species can hang on in the valley after clippings were relocated to five other old trees nearby. Ms Nouvet said the aim was for the clippings to seed the bark below, but the process could take up to a decade. There is about 33,024 hectares, or 46,000 football pitches, of rainforest left in Wales. Storms are just one of the threats to ancient woodlands such as Coed Felenrhyd which, according to the State of Wales Rainforest report, cover just 4.3% of country's rainforest landscape.

Waterfalls like this one in Afon Prysor gorge, in Eryri National Park, create the humidity that temperate rainforest species need to thrive

Much of this rainforest lacks connectivity to similar habitats because it is surrounded by farms or woodlands planted with non-native species. Some are grazed inappropriately, the survey said, and many are affected by rhododendrons that smother the forest floor in a dense shade that native species cannot tolerate. Farmer and retired forester Aled Thomas said the Celtic rainforest had been ""grazed since the beginning of time"", leading to the formation of these woodlands. But conservation efforts in the past saw many ancient woodlands fenced off. ""They have grown wild with invasive species coming in so none of the natural flowers associated with this type of woodland have been present,"" Mr Thomas explained.

Farmer Aled Thomas says grazing small Dexter cows in parts of the rainforest is helping to restore native species

Mr Thomas grazes small Dexter cattle in Coed y Gribin, a pocket of rainforest managed by the RSPB near Dolgellau. ""They will provide a habitat for a much more diverse species range by their hooves marking the ground, driving in acorns, rolling on the ground and they'll graze anything and everything,"" he said. ""They eat brambles like they are having supper."" Each animal is fitted with a GPS tracker and an alarm that trains them to keep to areas that need grazing and away from sensitive parts of the forest. ""The landscape has changed dramatically because the cows have been here for about three seasons and you notice there's very little bracken and there are bluebells coming up."" Mr Thomas said farms with more woodlands were the key to linking up isolated parts of the rainforest. ""You just don't need a field for growing cows, you can grow food by grazing in woodland and the benefits from that are huge to the forest and the farm.""

BBC The museum contains artefacts and furniture from prominent Parsi families

Tucked away in a lane in the southern end of India's financial capital, Mumbai, is a museum dedicated to the followers of one of the world's oldest religions, Zoroastrianism. The Framji Dadabhoy Alpaiwalla Museum documents the history and legacy of the ancient Parsi community - a small ethnic group that's fast dwindling and resides largely in India. Now estimated at just 50,000 to 60,000, the Parsis are believed to be descendants of Persians who fled religious persecution by Islamic rulers centuries ago. Despite their significant contributions to India's economic and cultural fabric, much about the Parsi community remains little known to the mainstream population and the wider world. ""The newly-renovated museum hopes to shake off some of this obscurity by inviting people to explore the history, culture and traditions of the Parsi community through the rare historical artefacts on display,"" says Kerman Fatakia, curator of the museum.

Some of these include cuneiform bricks, terracotta pots, coins and other objects sourced from places like Babylon, Mesopotamia, Susa and Iran and are dated to 4000-5000 BCE. These are places where Zoroastrian Iranian kings once ruled, like the Achaemenian, Parthian and Sasanian dynasties. There are also artefacts from Yazd, a city in central Iran which was once a barren desert and the place where many Zoroastrians settled after fleeing other regions of Iran after the Arab invasion in 7th Century BCE. One of the notable artefacts on display is a replica of a clay cylinder of Cyrus the Great, a Persian king who was the founder of the Achaemenid empire. Fatakia says the clay cylinder - also known as the ""Edict of Cyrus"" or the ""Cyrus Cylinder"" - is one of the most important discoveries of the ancient world. Inscribed in cuneiform script, it outlines the rights granted by Cyrus to his subjects in Babylon. Widely seen as the first human rights charter, a replica is also displayed at the United Nations. Then there are maps that trace the migration routes of thousands of Iranian Zoroastrians who fled their home country fearing persecution and travelled to India in the 8th to10th centuries, and again in the 19th century. The collection also features furniture, manuscripts, paintings, and portraits of prominent Parsis - among them Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, founder of the iconic Tata Group, which owns brands like Jaguar Land Rover and Tetley tea. Another striking section showcases artefacts collected by Parsis who grew wealthy in the early 19th century trading tea, silk, cotton - and notably, opium - with China. The exhibits include traditional Parsi sarees influenced by designs from China, France, and other regions shaped by these global trade ties.

The museum has a replica of a fire temple, which non-Parsis are not allowed to enter

Two of the museum's most compelling exhibits are replicas of a Tower of Silence and a Parsi fire temple. The Tower of Silence, or dakhma, is where Parsis leave their dead to be returned to nature - neither buried nor cremated. ""The replica shows exactly what happens to the body once it's placed there,"" says Fatakia, noting that entry to actual towers is restricted to a select few. The life-size replica of the fire temple is equally fascinating, offering a rare glimpse into a sacred space typically off-limits to non-Parsis. Modelled on a prominent Mumbai temple, it features sacred motifs inspired by ancient Persian architecture in Iran.

A woman balancing a dozen cocktails on a tray atop her head inched carefully through the steadily building crowds and chaos on Saturday morning at the Pimlico Race Course clubhouse. ""How much is that,"" a man in purple trousers yelled towards her, the glassware inches above her eyebrow clanking as she paused. ""Twenty dollars,"" she replied. Ray De Rubin repeated the number in disbelief, mumbled an expletive under his breath, then said: ""I'll take two."" He and his mother were at Pimlico for the first time - here to wager on US horse racing's esteemed Preakness Stakes on its 150th anniversary. Just two weeks ago, during his 14th trip to the Kentucky Derby, he won big. ""This is the exact same outfit I wore on Derby day. Same underwear, same socks, same hat,"" he said. ""I still got my Derby wristband on."" His wager at Pimlico? ""I can't tell you. I don't want the IRS coming after me,"" he said with a grin. On the other side of Pimlico – just beyond the thousand-dollar seats, champagne flutes, and air-conditioned tents on the infield – five thoroughbreds idled behind the starting line. Mr De Rubin had bets on three of them. There was a brief moment of quiet before the race. Then the gates flung open, and the horses took off. Mr De Rubin, eyes fixed on the screens above, stood frozen. But only for a moment. ""I get really loud when I watch the race. I put a lot of work into this,"" he said.

Tradition, but under a shadow

One of three annual thoroughbred races - along with the Kentucky Derby and the Belmont Stakes - that make up what is known as the Triple Crown, the Preakness Stakes has long been known as one of the most glamorously bacchanal events in US sports. Held at the Pimlico Race Course in Baltimore, Maryland, it brings together the rowdy and the rich. But this year, its traditions have been thrown into question. In his second term as president, Donald Trump has enforced swift, dramatic economic policy changes, leading to significant consumer pessimism. Virtually no corner of the American market has been spared - from the fast-food hamburger to the Preakness Stakes. Much of the current market-rattling turmoil is a result of Trump's sweeping global tariffs, announced on 2 April. Dubbed ""Liberation Day"", he said the new economic strategy would usher in ""the golden age of America"". Instead, in the 48 hours after his announcement, the S&P 500 had its worst two-day sell-off in years, as trillions of dollars were wiped from the stock market. Three weeks later, the International Monetary Fund warned of a global recession. Even McDonald's reported a drop in sales, which the burger chain's CEO attributed to customers ""grappling with uncertainty"". But while the stock market has mostly recovered following tariff agreements with the UK and China, the tariffs' impact may be just beginning; mega corporations like Walmart and Amazon recently warned of price increases.

BBC/Brandon Drenon

But at Pimlico, the state of Maryland is betting big, with plans to demolish the track right after Saturday's event and rebuild a new course in its place, plus a state-of-the-art training facility. The tariffs' shadow looms here, too. ""We expect there to be some kind of impact,"" the Maryland Stadium Authority told the BBC in a statement. But for now, they said the effects on the half-billion dollar project remains unclear. Aside from tariffs, horse race attendance has shrunk in recent years. Just over 46,000 people attended the Preakness in 2024, down from the 131,000 that attended in 2019. The Derby drew a much larger crowd of roughly 150,000 this year but was still well under its peak of 170,000 in 2015. Bill Carstanjen, CEO of the Derby's home, Churchill Downs, said a dip in sales this year was due to buyer ""hesitancy"" that ""correlates perfectly"" with Trump's tariffs. ""We didn't have the endless pool of demand that we've seen in prior years,"" Mr Carstanjen told the Lexington Herald.

'A little reprieve'

Still, gambling records this year were broken at the Derby and Preakness. Over a week before the Preakness and before the horses running were finalised, a Preakness record of $348,000 was wagered on betting futures, up from last year's record of $260,000. All just a drop in the bucket compared to the millions that will be wagered by the time the last horse crosses the finish line. University of Kentucky economics professor Justin Balthrop told the BBC that a rise in gambling also could be a sign of economic distress. ""People who reach a certain level of despair will start to take on more risk, in an effort to literally gamble their way back to a place where they feel like they can be more comfortable,"" Professor Balthrop said. ""You combine that with this idea that maybe they are so pessimistic, that this gives them the dopamine rush or endorphin release.""

BBC/Brandon Drenon Anthony Walker is attending his first Preakness Stakes

Waiting in a long line on Pimlico's infield, Anthony Walker was among those looking for ""a little reprieve"". He was glad ""to be able to take a few hours away from all that instability"" in the stock market as well as the disruption caused by Trump's downsizing of the federal government. Mr Walker planned to gamble – ""you can't come to the race without putting a little something out there"" – but a bit less than he might have in more certain times. ""I'm wagering 50% less, for sure,"" he estimated. ""Because of what's happening in the economy – the way this administration is taking a wrecking ball to the longstanding traditions and institutions that give credence to the American way of life."" At the Preakness, there are still endless ways to get a quick dose of gambling-induced dopamine. Even for as little as 10 cents. ""I've seen a 10 cent (wager) pay $75,000,"" said Peter Rotondo, who heads racing and wagering for 1/ST, the organisation running Preakness. To do so, one would have to wager on what's called a superfecta: correctly guessing which four horses will place in the top four in the exact order, odds that are about on par with getting struck by lightning. ""That's the beauty of the super,"" Mr Rotondo said.

'The most salacious party in sports'

The pricey cocktail Mr De Rubin grumbled about is the Black-Eyed Susan, also Maryland's official flower. The crazed concoction - bourbon, vodka, and a splash of mixers - leaves one to wonder whether it's truly a tribute to the state flower or a wink to the likely black eye after having too many. The drink is one of many traditions at the annual event. There's also the decades-old Tiffany & Co-made trophy called the Woodlawn Vase, considered ""the most valuable trophy in sports"". Made of 30lb of sterling silver, it's valued at an estimated $4m (£3m), and thus is kept in a museum most of the year. The Preakness winner leaves with a replica. But for many, the Preakness wouldn't be the Preakness without the party on the infield. ""I went a lot in my 20s and 30s. It was an absolutely crazy party,"" Bobby Duke, 51, said in an email to the BBC. ""In 1998, a guy jumped the fence and tried to punch a horse while racing. It's on YouTube."" Though Pimlico always had offerings for elegant, fans like Mr Duke fondly remember piling into the infield for ""the most salacious party on the sports calendar"", as ESPN once put it, where patrons would race across a long row of porta-pottys while dodging beer cans hurled at them by inebriated onlookers. (That tradition ended around 2009, when Pimlico stopped its BYOB policy.) Maryland officials said the new Pimlico will become a year-round racing facility, and hopefully bring an economic boost to the low-income Park Heights neighbourhood surrounding it.

Jesy Nelson/Instagram Jesy Nelson said her and her partner Zion Foster were 'so blessed'

Former Little Mix singer Jesy Nelson has announced the birth of her twin daughters. In a post on Instagram, the 33-year-old said that two girls were born prematurely at 31 weeks on Thursday but said they were ""healthy and fighting strong"". Nelson said her and her partner Zion Foster were ""so blessed"" and had ""never felt more in love"", sharing pictures of them holding the girls in hospital. They have been named Ocean Jade and Story Monroe Nelson-Foster.

Nelson wrote: ""So, our beautiful baby girls decided to come at 31 weeks plus five days. ""It all happened so quickly, but we are so blessed that they are here with us, healthy and fighting strong. We've never felt more in love."" Nelson previously revealed she had experienced rare complications during the twin pregnancy, which was first announced in January. In March, she said she had undergone a ""successful"" operation to prevent complications related to twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome (TTTS). The condition is caused by abnormal connecting blood vessels in the twins' placenta which leads to an imbalanced blood flow from one twin, known as the donor, to the recipient twin, leaving one baby with a greater blood volume than the other.

Nelson left Little Mix in 2020, saying she needed to protect her mental health",,

Kentucky residents pick through wreckage of homes destroyed by tornado

Missouri officials said 5,000 buildings had been damaged, roofs destroyed and power lines downed due to the tornado.

The Kentucky tornado struck Laurel County in the south-east of the state in the early hours of Saturday. Officials said they expected the death toll to rise.

Officials in Kentucky said there had been 18 deaths while seven people were killed in Missouri, including five in the city of St Louis.

At least 25 people are reported to have died and dozens are injured after tornadoes tore through parts of two US states.

About 140,000 properties in Missouri and Kentucky were left without power as of Saturday afternoon. Officials in St Louis said the fire department was conducting house-by-house searches in the worst-affected areas.

St Louis mayor Cara Spencer said in an update on Saturday that at least 38 people were reported injured in her area, largely from collapsed buildings and toppled trees.

Authorities in Kentucky said there were also severe injuries reported. ""The search is continuing in the damaged area for survivors,"" said Laurel County Sheriff John Root in a post on social media.

National Weather Service radar suggested the tornado touched down in Missouri shortly after 14:30 local time in the west of the city close to Forest Park - home to St Louis Zoo and the site of the 1904 Olympic Games.

St Louis Fire Department said three people had to be rescued after part of the nearby Centennial Christian Church collapsed. One of those people died.

A curfew was imposed from 21:00 to 06:00 local time in the two areas where most of the damage took place, to prevent injuries from debris and reduce the potential for looting.

St Louis mayor Spencer said: ""The loss of life and the destruction is truly, truly horrendous.

""We're going to have a lot of work to do in the coming days. There is no doubt there, but tonight we are focused on saving lives and keeping people safe and allowing our community to grieve.""

The US National Weather Service said tornadoes also hit neighbouring Illinois, with more severe weather conditions stretching eastwards to the Atlantic coast. On Saturday, it warned of few tornadoes that could hit northern Texas over the weekend as a result of strong to severe storms in the area.

The tornadoes struck an area of the US that is generally referred to as ""Tornado Alley"", where tornadoes are most frequent. They typically occur in the months of May and June, though they could strike during other times of the year.

Kentucky has seen an average of five tornadoes each May since the year 2000, while Missouri has seen an average of 16.",,

7 hours ago Share Save John Campbell BBC NI economics and business editor Share Save

BBC Laura Graham-Brown said that new sea border rules on parcels have made the situation much worse

A UK-EU summit is likely to pave the way for a deal which could substantially reduce the impact of the Irish Sea border. The UK wants to reset its post-Brexit relationship with the European Union ( EU) after years of tension. Monday's summit is expected to include an ""agreement to agree"" on trade issues, including the trade in food and agricultural products. If a full agri-food deal follows, potentially later this year, that will reduce the need for checks and controls on products being sent from GB to Northern Ireland.

It could mean the end of 'Not for EU' labelling and the removal of most physical checks on goods.

One food business in Belfast said the reset cannot come soon enough and that immediate measures are needed to help small firms. BBC News NI first spoke to the owners of Arcadia Deli in 2020 before the sea border started to be implemented. They have faced continuous struggles with the processes needed to get products from GB. Co-owner Laura Graham-Brown said that new sea border rules on parcels have made the situation much worse in the last month. ""Our partners in England have decided they are not supplying Northern Ireland until further notice until they can get some clarification on how to make it easier,"" she said. ""That is our biggest distributor so it is starting to tell on our counter as it becomes increasingly empty.""

She said she would welcome any deal that improves the situation but said something needs to change soon. ""All we want to do is sell cheese and olives. In order to keep stocking our shelves we need something to happen fairly quickly,"" she said. There are no guarantees about the scope of the agreement being negotiated and, on its own, it would not eliminate the sea border. Stuart Anderson from NI Chamber of Commerce said businesses would take time to analyse the detail of any deal. ""NI Chamber has been calling on the UK government to reach an agreement that is ambitious enough to substantially reduce bureaucracy for all operators in our agrifood supply chain,"" he said.

It comes as a poll from Queen's University Belfast suggests dwindling unionist support for Northern Ireland's current Brexit deal, the Windsor Framework. Professor David Phinnemore said there was an ""evident drop"" in the already limited unionist support that exists for the Windsor Framework particularly among those identifying as ""slightly unionist"". Support among that group has fallen from 51% to 26% over the last year. Prof Phinnimore said: ""If that trend is to be reversed, a closer UK-EU relationship needs to deliver on reducing obstacles to the GB-NI movement of goods.""

What has the UK government said?

The Labour government made a manifesto commitment to seek a new agri-food agreement with the EU which, it said, would aim to ""eliminate most border checks created by the Tory Brexit deal"". The deal would apply to the UK as a whole but would have the biggest impact in Northern Ireland. That is because NI is still effectively inside the EU's single market for goods but its supermarkets are mainly supplied from the UK. The Centre for European Reform (CER), a think tank, said that an agri-food deal would not be of ""great macroeconomic significance"" for the UK as a whole but that NI would be a ""major beneficiary"". It added: ""The closer UK regulations come to those of the EU, the less is the need for border controls on goods crossing the Irish Sea from Great Britain to Northern Ireland.""

Reuters For many unionists the Irish Sea borer is a constitutional affront which undermines NI's place in the UK

What is the Irish Sea border?

The Irish Sea border continues to have an impact on Northern Ireland's politics and its economy. It came about as the result of a Brexit deal between the EU and UK in 2019, which was revised in 2023, and is now known as the Windsor Framework. It was agreed that the most practical way to keep the border open between NI and the Republic of Ireland was for NI to follow many EU laws on the regulation of goods. This means that goods coming from the rest of the UK into NI face checks and controls to ensure they meet EU rules. For many nationalists in NI, this is a necessary compromise to minimise the impact of Brexit on the island of Ireland. For many unionists it is a constitutional affront which undermines NI's place in the UK. The largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), prevented NI's power-sharing government from operating between 2022 and 2024 in protest.

How could an agri-food deal change things?

Agri-food deals from the EU fall into two broad categories: New Zealand-style or Swiss-style. The EU's deal with New Zealand means that each party recognises that the other has high food standards and so the frequency of checks on products and paperwork is reduced. However, New Zealand still sets its own standards and a proportion of goods are still checked as they enter the EU. By contrast there are no regulatory border controls for trade in agri-food products between Switzerland and the EU. But the Swiss only have this deal because they agreed to follow EU rules almost to the letter, without much say in setting those rules. Switzerland is obliged to modify its laws in response to changes in EU legislation, what is known as dynamic alignment, and accept oversight from the European Court of Justice. A Swiss-style deal would mean controls on GB food products entering NI could be effectively ended. The EU has previously said this deal would be on offer to the UK but the government had retained an ambivalent stance on whether it would accept this. However in recent weeks ministers have been careful not to rule it out. Such a deal will face opposition from Brexit supporters who say it would involve surrendering powers which were returned to the UK after it left the EU.

Sixteen-year-old Nimra stood outside, rooted to the spot, as the Indian missiles that had woken her a moment ago rained down on the mosque a few metres from her house in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. She watched one tear the minaret off the top of the building. But she failed to realise she, too, had been struck - in the chest. When the family reached the relative safety of her aunt's house nearby, someone turned on a phone torch. ""My aunt gasped. There was blood on my frock. It was pink and white but now soaked in red. I hadn't seen it before."" Again they ran. ""I was running but my hand was pressed on my chest the whole time. I didn't want to take it off. I thought if I let go, everything inside me would come out."" A piece of shrapnel was lodged near her heart, she later discovered. A few hours later, in Poonch, Indian-administered Kashmir, a different family was dodging shelling which Pakistan had launched in response to India's missile strikes. ""When the firing began, everyone ran for their lives - children clinging to their parents in fear,"" said MN Sudhan, 72. ""Some families managed to leave for Jammu in their vehicles. We also decided to escape. But barely 10 minutes into our journey, a shell landed near our vehicle. The shrapnel tore through the car. My grandson died on the spot."" ""Our future was shattered at that [very] moment,"" Mr Sudhan said of 13-year-old Vihaan's death. ""Now we're left with nothing but grief. I have witnessed two wars between India and Pakistan, but never in my life have I seen shelling as intense as this.""

Nimra and Vihaan were among many of the villagers caught up in the deadliest attacks for several years in a decades-long conflict between two of the world's nuclear powers - India and Pakistan. Both sides administer the Himalayan region in part but claim it in full. Both governments deny targeting civilians, but BBC journalists in the region have spoken to families caught up in the violence. The strike that injured Nimra was part of India's armed response after a militant attack killed 26 people - mostly Indian tourists - last month at a beauty spot in India-administered Kashmir. Police there claimed militants included at least two Pakistan nationals. Pakistan has asked India for evidence of this, and has called for an independent inquiry into who was behind the attack. What followed was four days of tit-for-tat shelling and drone attacks, intensifying each day and culminating in missile strikes on military bases, which threatened to tip over into full-blown conflict. Then, suddenly, a ceasefire brokered by the US and other international players on 10 May brought the two nuclear powers back from the brink.

TASEER BEYG / BBC Nimra still has shrapnel lodged inside her body

Families on both sides of the Line of Control (LoC) - the de facto border in Kashmir - told us they had had loved ones killed and property destroyed. At least 16 people are reported to have been killed on the Indian side, while Pakistan claims 40 civilian deaths, though it remains unclear how many were directly caused by the shelling. We also heard from Indian and Pakistani government insiders about the mood in their respective administrations as the conflict escalated. In Delhi's corridors of power, the atmosphere was initially jubilant, an Indian government source told the BBC. Its missile attacks on targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and in Pakistan itself - including the Bilal Mosque in Muzaff arabad, which India claims is a militant camp, though Pakistan denies this - were deemed a success. ""The strikes… were not limited to Pakistani-administered Kashmir or along the Line of Control,"" an Indian government source told the BBC. ""We went deep - even into the Pakistani side of Punjab, which has always been Pakistan's red line."" But the Pakistani military had been prepared, a source from the Pakistan Air Force told the BBC. Days earlier, the Pakistani government said it was expecting an attack. ""We knew something was coming, and we were absolutely ready,"" one officer said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said Indian fighter jets approached Pakistani territory and the air force was under instructions to shoot down any that crossed into its airspace or dropped a payload. Pakistan claims to have shot down five Indian jets that night, something India has remained silent on. ""We were well prepared, and honestly, we were also lucky,"" the source said - his account repeated by two other sources. But Mr Sudhan, Vihaan's grandfather, said there had been no warning to stay indoors or evacuate. ""Why didn't they inform us? We, the people, are caught in the middle."" It is likely that no evacuation orders had been issued because the Indian government needed to keep the military strikes confidential, though the local administration had, following the April militant attack, directed locals to clean out community bunkers as a precautionary measure. A day after the initial missile strikes, Thursday, both sides launched drone attacks, though they each accused the other of making the first move. India began to evacuate thousands of villagers along the Indian side of the LoC. Just after 21:00 that evening, the Khan family in India-administered Kashmir decided they must flee their home in Uri, 270km (168 miles) to the north of Poonch. Most of their neighbours had already left. But after travelling for just 10 minutes, their vehicle was struck by shrapnel from a shell, fatally injuring 47-year-old Nargis. Her sister-in-law Hafeeza was seriously injured. They headed to the nearest hospital, only to find the gates locked. ""I somehow climbed the hospital wall and called out for help, telling them we had injured people with us. Only then did the staff come out and open the gate. As soon as they did, I collapsed. The doctors were terrified by the ongoing shelling and had closed everything out of fear,"" Hafeeza said. Hafeeza's sister-in-law Nargis is survived by six children. The youngest daughter Sanam, 20, said the first hospital they went to was not equipped to help, and as they headed to another, her mother died of her injuries.

SYED SHAHRIYAR / BBC Sanam's mother Nargis was fatally struck by shrapnel

""A piece of shrapnel had torn through her face. My clothes were soaked in her blood… We kept talking to her, urging her to stay with us. But she passed away on the way."" Since a ceasefire agreement between India and Pakistan in 2021 there had been relative peace in the region, locals told the BBC. For the first time in years, they had been able to live normal lives, they said, and now this sense of security was destroyed. Sanam, who lost her mother, said: ""I appeal to both governments - if you're heading into war, at least secure your civilians. Prepare... Those who sit in comfort and demand war - they should be sent to the borders. Let them witness what it really means. Let them lose someone before their eyes."" Sajjad Shafi, the representative for Uri in the regional government, said he had acted as promptly as possible. ""The moment I got the news that India has attacked, I got in touch with people and started moving them out."" After two days of attacks and counter attacks, the Indian government source said there was now a ""clear sense in… power corridors that things were escalating but we were ready. ""We were ready because India had spent the last 10 years acquiring and building strategic military assets - missiles, warheads and defence systems."" On the international stage, there had been consternation that the tensions would not be de-escalated by the US, despite its diplomatic overtures during India and Pakistan's previous Kashmir clashes. US Vice President JD Vance said a potential war would be ""none of our business"". This statement came as no surprise, the Indian government source told the BBC. At that stage, ""it was clear the US didn't want to get involved"". By the following day, Friday, shelling had become more intense. Muhammed Shafi was at home with his wife in Shahkot village in the Neelum Valley, Pakistan-administered Kashmir, on the LoC. The 30-year-old was standing in the doorway, just a few steps away from where his son was playing; his wife standing in their courtyard.

TASEER BEYG / BBC Muhammed's wife was killed by a strike very close to their house

""I remember looking up and seeing a mortar shell coming from a distance. In the blink of an eye, it struck her. She didn't even have time to scream. One second she was there, and the next, she was gone. Her face... her head... there was nothing left. Just a cloud of smoke and dust. My ears went numb. Everything went silent. I didn't even realise I was screaming. ""That night, her body lay there, right in our home. The entire village was hiding in bunkers. The shelling continued all night, and I stayed beside her, weeping. I held her hand for as long as I could."" One of those in a bunker was his niece, 18-year-old Umaima. She and her family were holed up in the shelter for four days, on and off, in brutal conditions. ""There were six or seven of us packed into it,"" she said. ""The other bunker was already full. There's no place to lie down in there - some people stood, others sat. There was no drinking water, no food,"" with people shouting, crying and reciting prayers in the pitch black. Also in a bunker, in the Leepa Valley, Pakistan-Administered Kashmir - one of the most militarised and vulnerable valleys in the region - was Shams Ur Rehman and family. It is Shams's own bunker, but that night he shared it with 36 other people, he said. Leepa is surrounded on three sides by the LoC and Indian-administered territory, so Shams was used to living with cross-border tensions. But he was not prepared for the complete destruction of his house. He left the bunker at three in the morning to survey the scene. ""Everything was gone. Wooden beams and debris from the house were scattered everywhere. The blast was so powerful, the shockwave pushed in the main wall. The metal sheets on the roof were shredded. The entire structure shifted - by at least two inches.

TASEER BEYG / BBC Shams Ur Rehman's house now has to be rebuilt after it was hit by three shells

""A house is a person's life's work. You're always trying to improve it - but in the end, it's all gone in seconds."" Four hours later, back in the Neelum Valley, Umaima and her family also emerged on Saturday 10 May to a transformed landscape. ""We came out of the bunker at seven in the morning. That's when we saw - nothing was left."" As Umaima surveyed the ruins of her village, India and Pakistan's forces that day were trading ever more destructive blows - firing missiles at each other's military installations, which both sides accused the other of instigating. India had targeted three Pakistani air bases, including one in Rawalpindi - the garrison city that houses the Pakistan Army's General Headquarters. ""This was a red line crossed,"" said one Pakistani officer. ""The prime minister gave the go-ahead to the army chief. We already had a plan, and our forces were desperately ready to execute it… For anyone in uniform, it was one of those unforgettable days.""

TASEER BEYG / BBC The Neelum valley lies along the Line of Control in Pakistan-administered territory

Pakistan hit back at Indian military installations. On the diplomatic front, this was seen as a moment to highlight the issue of Kashmir on the international stage, an official in the Pakistan foreign office told the BBC. ""It was non-stop. Endless meetings, coordination, and back-to-back calls to and from other countries for both foreign minister and then the prime minister. We welcomed mediation offers from the US, the Saudis, the Iranians, or anyone who could help de-escalate."" On the Indian side, the Pahalgam attack on 22 April had already prompted External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar to speak to at least 17 world leaders or diplomats, including UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov. In most of these conversations, he has tweeted, the emphasis had been on the ""cross-border terrorist attack"" and focused on building a case to hold the perpetrators accountable for the attack. Then, on Saturday afternoon local time, in the aftermath of the latest missile exchanges, came a diplomatic breakthrough out of nowhere. US President Donald Trump took to social media to reveal that a ceasefire had been agreed. ""After a long night of talks mediated by the United States, I am pleased to announce that India and Pakistan have agreed to a FULL AND IMMEDIATE CEASEFIRE. ""Congratulations to both Countries on using Common Sense and Great Intelligence,"" he wrote on social media platform Truth Social. India has since downplayed Washington's role in the ceasefire and it has rejected that trade was used as a lever to achieve this. Behind the scenes, US mediators, diplomatic backchannels and regional players, including the US, the UK and Saudi Arabia, had proved critical in negotiating the climbdown, experts say. ""We hit Pakistani strategic bases deep inside their territory and that must have worried the US,"" the Indian government source believes. In Pahalgam, the site of the militant gun attack that sparked the crisis, the search is still on for the perpetrators.

Vinay Narwal, a 26-year-old Indian Navy officer, was on his honeymoon in Pahalgam when he was killed. He had got married just a week before the attack. A photo of Vinay's wife Himanshi, sitting near her husband's body following the attack, has been widely shared on social media. His grandfather Hawa Singh Narwal wants ""exemplary punishment"" for the killers. ""This terrorism should end. Today, I lost my grandson. Tomorrow, someone else will lose their loved one,"" he said.

Watch: How snakes and spiders are milked for venom

With a pair of bright pink tweezers in hand, Emma Teni is delicately wrestling a large and leggy spider in a small plastic pot. ""He's posing,"" the spider-keeper jests as it rears up on its back legs. It is exactly what she's trying to achieve - that way she can suck the venom from its fangs using a small pipette. Emma works from a tiny office known as the spider milking room. On a typical day, she milks - or extracts the venom from - 80 of these Sydney funnel-web spiders. On three of the four walls there are floor-to-ceiling shelves stacked full of the arachnids, with a black curtain pulled across to keep them calm. The remaining wall is actually a window. Through it, a small child stares, both fascinated and horrified, as Ms Teni works. Little do they know that the palm-sized spider she's handling could kill them in a matter of minutes. ""Sydney funnel-webs are arguably the most deadly spider in the world,"" Emma says matter-of-factly. Australia is famously full of such deadly animals - and this room at the Australian Reptile Park plays a critical part in a government antivenom programme, which saves lives on a continent where it's often joked that everything wants to kill you.

'Spider girl'

While the quickest recorded death from a Sydney funnel-web spider was a toddler at 13 minutes, the average is closer to 76 minutes - and first aid gives you an even better chance of surviving. So successful is the antivenom programme here at the Australian Reptile Park that nobody has been killed by one since it started in 1981. The scheme relies, however, on members of the public either catching the spiders or collecting their egg sacs. In a van plastered with a giant crocodile sticker, each week Ms Teni's team drives all over Australia's most famous city, picking up Sydney funnel-webs that have been handed in at drop-off points such as local veterinary practices.

Spider keeper Emma Teni in her office at the Australian Reptile Park...

Where up to 80 Sydney funnel-web spiders are milked for their venom every day

There are two reasons why these spiders are so dangerous, she explains: not only is their venom extremely potent, but they also live exclusively in a densely populated region where they're more likely to encounter humans. Handyman Charlie Simpson is one such person. He moved into his first home with his girlfriend a few months ago, and the keen gardener has already found two Sydney funnel-webs. He took the second spider to the vet, where Ms Teni picked it up shortly after. ""I had gloves on at the time, but realistically I should have had leather gloves on because their fangs are so big and strong,"" the 26-year-old says. ""I [just thought] I had better catch it because I kept getting told you're meant to take them back to be milked, because it's so critical."" ""This is curing my fear of spiders,"" he jokes. As Ms Teni offloads one arachnid that was delivered to her in a Vegemite jar, she stresses her team isn't telling Australians to go looking for the spiders and ""throw themselves into danger"". Rather, they're asking that if someone comes across one, they safely capture it rather than kill it. ""Saying that this is the world's most deadly spider and then [asking the public to] catch it and bring it to us does sound counter-intuitive,"" she says. ""[But] that spider there now, thanks to Charlie, will… effectively save someone's life.""

Charlie Simpson says catching a Sydney funnel-web has helped him with his fear of the arachnids

All of the spiders her team collects get brought back to the Australian Reptile Park where they are catalogued, sorted by sex and stored. Any females that get dropped off are considered for a breeding programme, which helps supplement the number of spiders donated by the public. Meanwhile, the males, which are six to seven times more toxic than the females, are used for the antivenom programme and milked every two weeks, Emma explains. The pipette she uses to remove the venom from the fangs is attached to a suction hose - crucial for collecting as much venom as possible, since each spider provides only small amounts. While a few drops is enough to kill, scientists need to milk 200 of these spiders to have enough to fill one vial of antivenom. A marine biologist by training, Emma never expected to spend her days milking spiders. In fact, she started off working with seals. But now she wouldn't have it any other way. Emma loves all things arachnid, and goes under various nicknames - spider girl, spider mama, even ""weirdo"", as her daughter calls her. Friends, family and neighbours rely on her for her knowledge of Australia's creepy crawlies. ""Some girls arrive home to flowers on their doorstep,"" jokes Emma. ""For me it's not unusual to arrive home to a spider in a jar.""

Spiders represent just one small part of what the Australian Reptile Park does. It's also been providing snake venom to the government since the 1950s. According to the World Health Organisation, as many as 140,000 people die across the world from snake bites every year, and three times that many are left disabled. In Australia though, those numbers are far lower: between one and four people each year, thanks to its successful antivenom programme. Removing a King Brown snake from its storage locker, Billy Collett, the park's operations manager, brings it to the table in front of him. With his bare hands, he secures its head and puts its jaws over a shot glass covered in cling film.

Mr Collett collects venom from a King Brown snake

""They are very uninclined to bite but once they go, you just see it pouring out of the fangs,"" Mr Collett says, as yellow venom drips to the bottom. ""That is enough to kill all of us in the room five times over - maybe more."" Then he switches to a more reassuring tone: ""They're not looking for people to bite. We're too big for them to eat; they don't want to waste their venom on us. They just want to be left alone."" ""To get bitten by a venomous snake, you've got to really annoy it, provoke it,"" he adds, noting that bites often occur when someone is trying to kill one of the reptiles. There's a fridge in the corner of the room where the raw venom Mr Collett is collecting is stored. It's full of vials labelled ""Death Adder"", ""Taipan"", ""Tiger Snake"" and ""Eastern Brown"". The last of these is the second-most venomous snake in the world, and the one that's most likely to bite you here, in Australia.

No one in Australia has been killed by a Sydney Funnel-web Spider since 1981 when the antivenom programme started

This venom gets freeze-dried and sent to CSL Seqirus, a lab in Melbourne, where it's turned into an antidote in a process that can take up to 18 months. The first step is to produce what's known as hyper-immune plasma. In the case of snakes, controlled doses of the venom are injected into horses, because they are larger animals with a strong immune system. The venom of Sydney funnel-web spiders goes into rabbits, which are immune to the toxins. The animals are injected with increasing doses to build up their antibodies. In some cases, that step alone can take almost a year. The animal's supercharged plasma is removed from the blood, and then the antibodies are isolated from the plasma before they're bottled, ready to be administered. CSL Seqirus makes 7,000 vials a year – including snake, spider, stonefish and box jellyfish antivenoms - and they are valid for 36 months. The challenge then is to ensure everyone who needs it has supplies. ""It's an enormous undertaking,"" says Dr Jules Bayliss, who leads the antivenom development team at CSL Seqirus. ""First and foremost we want to see them in major rural and remote areas that these creatures are likely to be in."" Vials are distributed depending on the species in each area. Taipans, for example, are in northern parts of Australia, so there's no need for their antivenom in Tasmania. Antivenom is also given to the Royal Flying Doctors, who access some of the nation's most remote communities, as well as Australian navy and cargo ships for sailors at risk of sea snake bites.

Mr Collett says snakes won't waste their venom on humans, who are too big for them to eat",,

Most journalists travelling with the US president don't see much of the interior of Air Force One, the presidential jet. The press cabin is in the back of the plane, accessible by a rear set of steps and a quick turn of a corner. To reach the presidential suite at the front of the plane would require negotiating with the armed Secret Service agents in the next-door cabin. On Donald Trump's trip to the Middle East this week, when the future of the famous plane was a huge talking point, Fox News host Sean Hannity had priority seating and access to the president to conduct an in-flight interview. But the rest of us in the travelling press pool were consigned to our small section of the plane. It was a whirlwind trip, hitting three nations in three nights, half a world away. The president described it as an ""endurance test"" - one that his staff and those of us in the press pool had to manage, as well. The presidential jet is not a bad way to fly, however. The 14 seats are comfortable, roughly on par with a first-class domestic flight. There's a bathroom and a table with snacks (including the coveted Air Force One-branded M&Ms bearing the president's signature, which aren't available anywhere else). Qatar's Air Force One offer angers Trump supporters

Is Trump allowed to accept 747 gift? The cabin has a pair of television monitors - usually tuned to the president's preferred cable news channel (CNN during Joe Biden's term; Fox News for Trump). On occasion, they've been set to a football game or other sporting events. For longer flights, the on-board kitchen serves plated meals (the president eats from a different, fancier menu). On short hops, there's usually food in a takeaway bag.

Watch: President Trump takes a question from the BBC's Anthony Zurcher on board

But the interior of this famous aircraft could soon undergo a radical refit if, as looks likely, Trump accepts the Qatari offer to supply a new ""palace in the sky"" - the biggest foreign gift ever received by a US president. Technically, ""Air Force One"" is a radio call sign, the designation for any Air Force aircraft with the US president aboard. The small prop plane Lyndon Baines Johnson took from Austin to his Texas ranch in the 1960s was Air Force One, too. But the Air Force One most people picture, the one featured in the Harrison Ford action film, is the Boeing 747-200b with water blue, steel blue and white paint set against a chrome underbody - a colour scheme picked out by First Lady Jackie Kennedy in 1962. Currently there are two of these 747s in the Air Force passenger fleet, in use since 1990. Needless to say, technology – both in aircraft design and everything else – has come a long way in the ensuing years. The planes have been upgraded, but the costs of maintaining the airframe and engines are growing. The aircraft are showing their age.

This has clearly irked the current White House occupant – the only president to own his own jet, or for that matter, his own airline, prior to taking office. ""I leave now and get onto a 42-year-old Boeing,"" he said, exaggerating the plane's age during an industry briefing on Thursday in Abu Dhabi. ""But new ones are coming."" Coming, but not soon enough for Trump. During his first term, he touted an updated presidential aircraft, made by Boeing, that was in the works. He even picked out his own colour palette, scrapping Kennedy's design for a red-white-and-blue livery. He proudly displays a model of that jet in the Oval Office. Originally planned to be delivered by 2021, delays and cost overruns for the estimated $4bn construction programme have made it less likely that the two new planes on order will be available for much, if any, of Trump's second term in office, which expires in January 2029. He has tasked tech multi-billionaire Elon Musk with speeding up the process and reportedly groused in private that he is embarrassed to travel in such an outdated plane.

That explains why the president has become enamoured with the prospect of a seemingly more immediate solution to his air transport woes – courtesy of the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. News of Qatar's offer of a lavish $400m (£301m) 747-8 made headlines last week, but the gift apparently has been in the works for months. Trump surreptitiously visited the aircraft in question in mid-February, just a few weeks after the start of his second term in office. Aside from the legal and ethical concerns of such a substantial gift – raised by critics and some allies of the president - converting a foreign 747 for use by an American president creates a number of technical challenges. The aircraft would have to be made capable of in-flight refuelling and retrofitted with a sophisticated package of communications and security equipment. The current models have systems built to withstand the electromagnetic pulse of a nuclear explosion.

Getty Images President Obama making calls on board in 2012

Such a refitting process, says aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia, managing director of AeroDynamic Advisory, would take years, until 2030 at least. ""They have to assume the jet has been left unattended in a dangerous place for 13 years,"" he says. ""Which means it's not enough to take the plane apart. You also have to take every single component apart."" The plane would need additional power to run its new systems, and its interior might have to be rearranged. Chances are there's no press cabin in the flying palace as originally designed. Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' Defense and Security Department, says the costs of such retrofitting could easily run to $1bn (£750m). He adds, however, that Trump could waive some, or all, of the security modifications if he so chooses. ""He's the president,"" he said. When the Air Force ultimately does retire its current crop of 747s, it will put to pasture an aircraft that have been part of fabric of American history for decades. One that transported President Bill Clinton, along with former Presidents Jimmy Carter and George HW Bush, to Israel for Yitzhak Rabin's funeral in 1995. After the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon, George W Bush took to the skies in Air Force One and stayed aloft for hours, refuelling mid-air, until his security team determined it was safe for him to land and address the nation, before ultimately returning to Washington.

Video shows ship crashing into Brooklyn Bridge

Brooklyn resident Nick Corso, who witnessed the accident, said the area erupted in panic. There was ""lots of screaming, some sailors hanging from the masts,"" he told AFP.

Footage shows the ship's towering masts clip the bridge as it passed under the structure. Crew members were standing on the masts as they snapped and fell to the deck, authorities said.

Police said the Cuauhtémoc, with 277 people on board, lost power on Saturday as the captain was manoeuvring the vessel, forcing it to head for the bridge abutment on the Brooklyn side.

Two people have been killed and at least 19 others injured after a tall Mexican Navy training sailing ship crashed into New York City's Brooklyn Bridge.

Damaged masts on the Mexican Navy training ship Cuauhtémoc after it crashed into New York City's Brooklyn Bridge

New York City Mayor Eric Adams confirmed on X that two people died and two of the 19 injured were in critical condition.

Brooklyn Bridge did not suffer any major damage and was reopened after a preliminary inspection.

Police said they believed ""mechanical issues"" and a power cut had caused the collision.

The New York Coast Guard said the Cuauhtémoc lost all three masts. All personnel on the ship had been accounted for and no-one had fallen in the water.

Crowds fled from the water's edge as the ship hit the bridge.

Another witness, Kelvin Flores, told the BBC he was at work when he saw the crash.

He came out into the street to find a lot of ""commotion and a lot of chaos"" with fire engines and police trying to reach the scene but the roads clogged with traffic.

""Just seeing the actual damage was insane,"" he said. ""People carrying stretchers... they were trying to get the injured out.""

Mexico's President Claudia Sheinbaum said she was deeply saddened by the loss of two crew members in the accident.

The Cuauhtémoc was towed from the scene after the crash.

The vessel, which measures 297 feet long (91m) and 40 feet (12m) wide, according to the Mexican navy, sailed for the first time in 1982.

Each year it sets sail at the end of classes at the naval military school to finish cadets' training.

This year it left the Mexican port of Acapulco on 6 April, the navy said. Its final destination was intended to be Iceland.

Police said the Cuauhtémoc's mast height was 48.2m (158ft). The New York transport department's website says the bridge has a 135ft clearance at its centre.",,

Michael Beaumier, a witness, said he was knocked off his bike by the blast. ""It was that big of an explosion and I could hear windows shattering all around me,"" he said.

The FBI later said it had ""a person of interest"" in its investigation, but officers were ""not actively searching"" for the suspect.

The blast happened just before 11:00 local time (19:00 BST) less than a mile from downtown Palm Springs, near several businesses including the American Reproductive Centers (ARC). The clinic said no-one from the facility was harmed.

A bomb explosion outside a California fertility clinic has killed one person and injured four others in an ""intentional act of terrorism"", FBI officials have said.

Rhino Williams, who was at his restaurant nearby, told the BBC he initially thought the explosion was a plane or helicopter crashing.

He said he ran to the scene to see if he could help, finding a badly damaged building with walls blown out and the front axle of a car on fire in the car park.

""That's all that was left of it,"" Mr Williams said. He also saw an iPhone on a tripod still standing in the car park, as if it was set to film or stream the explosion.

Mr Williams said he rushed through the building shouting for any injured people - but did not find any. A few minutes later first responders arrived.

Nima Tabrizi, another witness, said he heard a ""big boom"", a large cloud of smoke and the front of the clinic ""completely blown out"".

The FBI said in a Saturday briefing that it was a deliberate attack.

""This was an intentional act of terrorism. As our investigation will unfold we will determine if it's international terrorism or domestic terrorism,"" said Akil Davis, the head of the FBI's Los Angeles field office.

Palm Springs police chief Andy Mills said the blast damaged several buildings, some severely.

He added that the identity of the person who was killed was not known.

The ARC in Palm Springs said the explosion occurred in the car park near its building.

Palm Springs Mayor Ron De Harte told BBC's US partner CBS News that the source of the explosion ""was in or near the vehicle"".

The fertility clinic said their lab, including all eggs and embryos, remained ""fully secure and undamaged"".

""We are heavily conducting a complete safety inspection and have confirmed that our operations and sensitive medical areas were not impacted by the blast,"" the clinic said in its statement.

But Dr Maher Abdallah, who runs the clinic, told the Associated Press that the clinic's office was damaged.

""I really have no clue what happened,"" he said. ""Thank God today happened to be a day that we have no patients.""

According to its website, the ARC clinic is the first full-service fertility centre and in vitro fertilisation lab (IVF) in the Coachella Valley.

It offers services including fertility evaluations, IVF, egg donation and freezing, reproductive support for same-sex couples and surrogacy.

Watch: Key moments from Eurovision 2025

Austrian singer JJ has won the Eurovision Song Contest in Basel, Switzerland, after a nail-biting finish that saw him topple Israel from pole position at the very last minute. The 24-year-old, who is a counter-tenor at the Vienna State Opera, took the title with the song Wasted Love, a tempestuous electro-ballad about unrequited love. ""Thank you so much for making my dreams come true,"" he said as he accepted the coveted glass microphone trophy. ""Love is the strongest force in the world, let's spread more love."" The singer scored 436 points, with Israel in second place on 357 and Estonia third on 356. The UK's act, Remember Monday, placed 19th with 88 points. 'What the Hell Just Happened' to the UK entry?

JJ's younger sister broke through security guards to hug him after his victory was announced. The Austrian said his whole family had arrived to support him at the contest, including his 85-year-old grandfather, and a four-month-old niece, who watched outside with his brother. It is the third time Austria has won the contest, with previous victories going to Udo Jürgens' Merci, Cherie in 1966; and Conchita Wurst with Rise Like a Phoenix in 2014. JJ was inspired to take part in Eurovision by Conchita. The singer had always been one of the favourites to win, but the most hotly-tipped contestants were Sweden's KAJ - whose tongue-in-cheek ode to sauna culture, Bara Bada Bastu, ultimately took fourth place. Speaking after the show, JJ said he was ""so pleased"" that viewers had connected with his story of heartache. ""I wanted to let them have an insight on my deepest soul [and] how I felt when we wrote the song."" ""What I'm trying to commit [to] is that there's no wasted love. There's so much love that we can spread around. It's the strongest force on planet earth."" Asked how he would celebrate, he replied: ""Honestly, I need to sleep now. I'm tired.""

Corinne Cumming / EBU Yuval Raphael represented Israel, amid protests over the country's involvement

For the second year in a row, there was controversy over Israel's participation, with protestors arguing for the country's dismissal over its military action in Gaza. Pro-Palestinian protests took place on the streets of Basel in the hours before the contest. Later, a man and a woman were prevented from invading the stage during Israel's performance. ""One of the two agitators threw paint and a crew member was hit,"" said Swiss broadcaster SRG SSR in a statement to the BBC. ""The crew member is fine and nobody was injured. ""The man and the woman were taken out of the venue and handed over to the police."" The performance, by young singer Yuval Raphael, was unaffected. The 25-year-old is a survivor of the Hamas attacks of 7 October, 2023, an experience which coloured her delicate ballad, New Day Will Rise. The Israeli delegation said Raphael was left ""shaken and upset"" by the incident, but that it was ""extremely proud"" of her performance ""which represented Israel in a respectful manner"".

Elsewhere, Eurovision was its usual explosion of high camp, sexual innuendo and dresses being removed to reveal smaller, tighter dresses. Malta's Mariana Conte was forced to rewrite her disco anthem Serving Kant to remove what sounded like a swear word - but performed the censored version with a knowing wink, safe in the knowledge the audience would fill in the blanks. Although it was a fan favourite, Conte could only manage 17th. Estonia's Tommy Cash, who came third, also kept the innuendo train running, with Espresso Macchiato, a caffeinated disco anthem featuring the unforgettable phrase: ""Life is like spaghetti, it's hard until you make it."" Another highlight was Finland's Erika Vikman, who dispensed with double entendres entirely on Ich Komme, a vibrant hymn to sexual pleasure. The singer ended her performance by taking flight on a giant phallic microphone that shot sparks into the air. It thrust her into 11th position, and a permanent place in the Eurovision pantheon.

The contest also dealt with more weighty subjects like economic migration (Portuguese rock band Napa) and environmental catastrophe (Latvia's Tautumeitas, who scored 12 points from the UK jury). Dutch singer Claude delivered a heartfelt tribute to his mother in C'est La Vie - an upbeat anthem that reflected on her positivity as she uprooted the family from their home country of the Democratic Republic of Congo as a child. In a touching climax, the 21-year-old danced with an image of his childhood self in a mirror on the stage.

Also reflecting on their childhood was French singer Louane, whose tearjerking ballad was dedicated to her mother, who died of cancer when she was 17. In one of the night's most striking performances, she was surrounded by a whirlwind of sand as she hollered the word ""mother"" over and over again. One of the favourites to win, it ended the night in seventh place, after receiving a disappointing 50 points from the public. JJ's performance was similarly dramatic. Shot entirely in black and white, it saw him being tossed around on a rickety boat, as waves (of emotion) threatened to consume him. An honourable mention also goes to Italy's Lucio Corsi, whose harmonica solo in Volevo Essere Un Duro marked the first time a live instrument has been played at Eurovision since 1998.

Alma Bengtsson / EBU Remember Monday's performance included a callback to Bucks Fizz's skirt-shedding performance at the 1981 Eurovision Song Contest

The UK spent a third year in the bottom half of the leaderboard, despite a spirited performance from girl group Remember Monday. A group of friends who met at high school, their inventive pop song What The Hell Just Happened? drew on their many years of experience in West End theatre. The girls pulled off their tricky three-part harmonies while dancing around a fallen chandelier, but the performance didn't connect with voters. Despite earning a healthy 88 points from juries - including 12 from Italy - it bombed with viewers. They ended in 19th place, one below last year's entrant Olly Alexander. The group laughed off their ""nul points"" score from the public, holding up peace signs and hugging each other as the score was announced.

The voting was utter chaos. Thirteen of the 26 finalists received the maximum of 12 points from at least one jury, leaving the competition completely open before the public vote was counted. Israel, who had been languishing in the bottom half of the table, then received 297 points from the public (out of a possible maximum of 444). Twelve of those points came from the UK. For a while, it looked like Yuval Raphael's lead might be unassailable - but Austria's tally of 178 was the last to be announced, leaving the singer empty-handed. And spare a thought for Switzerland. Their contestant, Zoë Më, was in second place after the jury vote, with 214 points. Then the public gave her the night's only other zero-point score.

Hamas on Saturday offered to release nine hostages in exchange for a 60-day truce, a Palestinian official told the BBC after new negotiations were held in Qatar.

Israel's military on Saturday announced the launch of ""Operation Gideon's Chariot"", amid the deadliest wave of strikes in Gaza in months.

Medical staff and patients at the Indonesian hospital, in Beit Lahia, came under ""heavy fire... preventing the arrival of patients, medical staff, and supplies"", the ministry said on Sunday.

Israeli forces have besieged a hospital in northern Gaza as they continue an offensive to seize territory in the strip, the Hamas-run health ministry has said.

The health ministry said that three public hospitals were now ""out of action"" in the North Gaza governorate.

At least 300 people have been killed since Thursday, including at hospitals and refugee camps in the north and south of the Strip, Hamas-run authorities have said.

Strikes on Saturday hit towns in the north of Gaza, including Beit Lahia and the Jabalia refugee camp, as well as in the southern city of Khan Younis, the Hamas-run health ministry and civil defence forces said.

Thousands have died since Israel resumed strikes on 18 March, following the collapse of a fragile ceasefire which lasted two months.

Israel's military has said the expansion of its campaign is aimed at ""achieving all the war's objectives"" including releasing hostages and ""the defeat of Hamas"".

Aid agencies say Gaza's humanitarian situation has also worsened, as Israel has been blocking supplies of food and other aid from entering the territory for 10 weeks.

Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu earlier this month promised a major military escalation in the war to occupy and control swathes of Gaza, force the Palestinian population to the south of the territory, and ""destroy"" Hamas.

Netanyahu said on 5 May that Israel was preparing an ""intense entry into Gaza"" to capture and hold territory, but that it would not commence until Trump completed his tour of the Middle East. He left the region on Friday.

The war was triggered by the Hamas-led attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which saw about 1,200 people killed and more than 250 taken hostages.

Some 58 hostages remain in Gaza, up to 23 of whom are believed to be alive.

BBC Amit Ghose was born with Neurofibromatosis type 1

Subjected to brutal bullying as a child, Amit Ghose says he still has to deal with constant staring, pointing and comments, and has even been refused service in a cafe because of his face. The 35-year-old from Birmingham described how visiting an independent coffee shop in London recently ""everyone was staring at me, and it was like they'd almost seen a ghost"". ""The person serving looked at me and said: 'Oh, we're not serving any more'. ""She turned around and walked off. But clearly, clearly they were still serving.""

Amit was born with Neurofibromatosis type 1, a condition that causes non-cancerous tumours to grow along nerves. But after ""learning acceptance"" of his facial disfigurement he now shares his motivational story in schools with the aim of helping children ""embrace their personalities and celebrate who they are"".

Amit Ghose Amit Ghose had surgery to remove his eye when he was 11

Another recent experience of abuse spurred him on to self publish a children's book, Born Different. ""I had a couple of individuals come over to me in a park and ask me what happened to my face, and I thought they were just being curious,"" he said. ""But actually they started laughing, giggling, saying: 'Oh my God, if I had a face like you I wouldn't even come out my house'."" He said the encounter ""really upset"" him, ""and I thought to myself, I need to do something about this. I need to get this book out. Now is the right time"". ""If I had this book when I was a young child, I think it would have helped me.""

Amit Ghose After suffering bullying at school it was joining the cricket team that helped him make friends

Amit had his left eye surgically removed at the age of 11, leading to further facial disfigurement as well as abuse and bullying. In the run up to Halloween one year, a child at school told him ""you don't need a Halloween mask, you've got one for life"", he recalled. ""That broke me to the point where I did not accept the left hand side of my face,"" he said. ""For a very, very long time I hid the face, I just was not comfortable showing it to the world at all.""

Looking back, he said he had not understood the depth of depression and anxiety he experienced then. ""Other children not wanting to come and sit next to me or hiding behind their parents all had a mental effect on me,"" he said. At school, cricket was his passion and it was through playing the game that he eventually made friends. ""Cricket helped me become Amit, that boy who plays cricket, from Amit, the boy who has a funny face,"" he explained.

Amit Ghose The motivational speaker said he hoped the book would help children celebrate who they were

But, he said, even as an adult he still experienced ""constant staring"". ""The pointing, the tapping the friend next to them saying 'have you seen that guy's face', that is also constant,"" he said. ""But there is kindness out there as well, and that needs highlighting.""

'This is me, take it or leave it'

It was his wife Piyali who eventually taught him the ""art of acceptance,"" he explained. ""Really that I've got to accept myself before others can accept me,"" he added. She also persuaded him to start sharing his story on social media. ""I thought TikTok was all about singing and dancing, and I thought maybe not, but she convinced me. ""I created a video and I said to the world: 'I want to take you all on a journey to help and support and inspire you using my lived experiences.'"" He started his account in early 2023, and has since gone on to gain almost 200,000 followers and millions of likes. ""Me helping people on social media by sharing my story has helped me become more accepting of myself. ""Now I say to the world, this is me, take it or leave it.""

He is also about to launch a podcast in which he speaks to others who have had similar experiences, including Oliver Bromley who was ejected from a restaurant because staff said he was ""scaring the customers"". ""We're going to have lots of fun and inspire a lot of people,"" he said. ""Disability or no disability, visible difference or no visible difference, we all have insecurities, we all have things that we're faced with, and challenges we're faced with.

When Romania's presidential election was annulled late last year after claims of Russian interference, a far-right conspiracy theorist was blocked from the top job. Many Romanians were deeply relieved; many others were angry their votes had been stolen. But six months later, with the country back at the ballot box, another hard-right Euro-sceptic is in the running for president. George Simion won the first round of the new elections on 4 May by a large margin. Now the former football casual turned nationalist politician is facing off against Nicusor Dan, the liberal mayor of Bucharest. It's a vote that could see Romania, a member of both Nato and the European Union (EU), take a sharp turn away from the European mainstream.

Both candidates cast their votes on Sunday morning, with Simion saying he had voted for the future ""that should be decided only by Romanians, for Romanians and for Romania"". Dan told reporters he was voting for ""collaboration with our European partners and not for [the] isolation of Romania"". The polls have been too close to call. Teleorman county is one of Romania's poorest areas and has been solidly social-democrat territory for many years. But earlier this month, 57% of voters here chose Simion for president in the first round of voting.

Petre Filip shows his original packaging machine, which now stands in the lobby as a reminder of the early days

A couple of hours' drive south-west from Bucharest, entry to the region is announced in blue letters on a rusty metal arch over the main road. The streets are lined with wild poppies, not campaign posters for the candidates. There's no obvious sign of the elections. But social media feeds on people's phones are full of political content. The latest clip to go viral features a folk fantasy world of embroidered tops, prayers and bears and has the slogan ""I choose Romania"". ""It was an anti-system, anti-mainstream vote,"" is how Felicia Alexandru of Aperio Intelligence explains the nationwide surge of support for the far-right candidate in the first round. After more than three decades of the same parties dominating politics, frustration with corruption and poor performance has been building. ""People are so unhappy with what happened in high level politics, this is a vote against that,"" Felicia says. The protest vote is not confined to the poorest or most disaffected. The Comalat dairy firm is unrecognisable from the business Petre Filip launched 25 years ago. Back then, he would set out at 05:00 every day in his Dacia to drive round farms buying up milk. Then, each evening, he hand-delivered the cheese and yoghurt produced by his three workers to clients. His old packaging machine now stands in the lobby as a reminder of the early days. But Petre has since been granted €1.5m (£1.3m; $1.7m) in EU funding to modernise and expand his business. It's money he never has to pay back. ""That was a really, really good thing for us,"" the businessman enthuses, showing off a production line of glistening metal machines in several rooms. He employs more than 50 staff.

Mihaela argues that George Simion is ""on the side of Romanians""

""I like George Simion,"" staff member Mihaela announces with a smile, while squeezing liquid from big clumps of curd cheese. She shrugs when I mention the fear in Brussels that he would make EU-Romania relations very turbulent. ""He's on the side of Romanians. He's for the people. To create jobs and better lives,"" Mihaela replies. Simion talks a lot about ""making Romania great again"", echoing the MAGA politicians in the US he so admires. He has the same isolationist approach, too: Romania first, in everything. When pushed, he has called Russian President Vladimir Putin a war criminal for his invasion of Ukraine. But like Donald Trump, he has also pledged to end military aid to Kyiv and he's left the future of Ukraine's vital grain exports via Romania unclear. Simion has been banned from Ukraine and Moldova for calling for territory there to be part of Romania. In his latest outbursts this week, he called his election opponent ""autistic, poor guy"". He also accused French President Emmanuel Macron of having ""dictatorial tendencies"". Mr Filip says Simion is ""far too impulsive"" to be president, driven ""by hormones not his brain"". But he is so disillusioned by the whole scene he's inclined not to vote at all. Just up the road in Roșiori de Vede, they are discussing the elections too - and fretting.

Andrew Fusek Peters Photographer Andrew Fusek Peters captured a goldfinch with rainbow-effect wings in his Shropshire garden

A photographer has spent a decade carrying out ""garden safaris"" in order to capture the diversity and beauty of Britain's back garden wildlife. The images, including battling birds and squabbling squirrels, showed just what could be found ""under our noses"", said Andrew Fusek Peters. ""I wanted to celebrate the everyday stories and reveal the beauty of our birds, mammals and insects that live alongside us,"" the Shropshire photographer added. Hundreds of his images feature in a new book.

The majority of the photographs were taken in his ""modest"" garden, and local village of Lydbury. ""You don't have to travel to nature reserves or mountains,"" he said. ""I sometimes get snobbery from the big photographers who go to Africa and do the lions and tigers, or Greenland for the Polar bears,"" he explained. ""And they think I'm somehow inferior because I do blue tits in the garden.""

Andrew Fusek Peters The photographer set up a hide on a domestic lawn to capture this rare image of a mother hare suckling her leveret

But, he added, capturing rare images such as a hare feeding her leveret on someone's back lawn was ""just amazing"". ""At the time I took it, that had been photographed maybe less than 10 times in the world,"" he said. ""It was sheer gold on my memory card."" He had also travelled to other parts of the UK in order to capture other ""extraordinary moments,"" including a fox family playing in Clapham, south London, and a pair of red squirrels on the Isle of Wight.

Andrew Fusek Peters This pair of brightly coloured bramblings fighting over food was one of the photographer's favourite shots

Mr Fusek Peters started concentrating on his own garden wildlife after a diagnosis of bowel cancer in 2018, perfecting a technique to ""make time stop"" to get shots of birds and butterflies taking off and in mid flight. Using his kitchen as a hide, he has also taken rare pictures of birds - showing the effect of diffraction on their wings, giving a rainbow effect. ""This winter I got a woodpecker and a nuthatch"" he said, adding the images were ""extraordinary"". ""Everyone's going to accuse me of using AI, but it's not - it's actually scientific."" He added he was ""one of the few in the world"" to have taken such images. ""I just seem to have this blessed luck when I concentrate on what's out of the kitchen window.""

The book was also a ""rallying cry"" to transform ""over-manicured spaces into more wildlife friendly havens,"" he said. ""These places are important, I think they really are,"" he added. ""As we know with climate change and with what's happening with habitat a lot of species are really suffering, and that includes our garden visitors so it's important to showcase them. ""They are just as important as all the wonderful creatures of the jungle and the desert,"" he added.

14 hours ago Share Save Stephen McDonell China correspondent Reporting from Beijing Share Save

EPA Australian Matthew Radalj was held for five years in a Beijing detention centre, similar to the one pictured above in 2012

Sharing a dirty cell with a dozen others, constant sleep deprivation, cells with lights on 24-hours a day; poor hygiene and forced labour. These are some of what prisoners in Chinese jails are subjected to, according to Australian citizen Matthew Radalj, who spent five years at the Beijing No 2 prison – a facility used for international inmates. Radalj, who is now living outside China, has decided to go public about his experience, and described undergoing and witnessing severe physical punishment, forced labour, food deprivation and psychological torture. The BBC has been able to corroborate Radalj's testimony with several former prisoners who were behind bars at the same time he was. Many requested anonymity, because they feared retribution on loved ones still living inside the country. Others said they just wanted to try to forget the experience and move on. The Chinese government has not responded to the BBC's request for comment.

A harsh introduction

""I was in really bad shape when I arrived. They beat me for two days straight in the first police station that I was in. I hadn't slept or eaten or had water for 48 hours and then I was forced to sign a big stack of documents,"" said Radalj of his introduction to imprisonment in China, which began with his arrest on 2 January, 2020. The former Beijing resident claims he was wrongfully convicted after a fight with shopkeepers at an electronics market, following a dispute over the agreed price to fix a mobile phone screen. He claims he ended up signing a false confession to robbery, after being told it would be pointless to try to defend his innocence in a system with an almost 100% criminal conviction rate and in the hope that this would reduce the time of his incarceration. Court documents indicate that this worked at least to some extent, earning him a four-year sentence. Once in prison, he said he first had to spend many months in a separate detention centre where he was subjected to a more brutal ""transition phase"".

Matthew Radalj Radalj had lived in Beijing for a number of years when he was arrested in January 2020

During this time prisoners must follow extremely harsh rules in what he described as horrific conditions. ""We were banned from showering or cleaning ourselves, sometimes for months at a time. Even the toilet could be used only at specific allotted times, and they were filthy - waste from the toilets above would constantly drip down on to us."" Eventually he was admitted to the ""normal"" prison where inmates had to bunk together in crowded cells and where the lights were never turned off. You also ate in the same room, he said. According to Radalj, African and Pakistani prisoners made up the largest groups in the facility, but there were also men being held from Afghanistan, Britain, the US, Latin America, North Korea and Taiwan. Most of them had been convicted for acting as drug mules.

The 'good behaviour' points system

Radalj said that prisoners were regularly subjected to forms of what he described as psychological torture. One of these was the ""good behaviour points system"" which was a way – at least in theory – to reduce your sentence. Prisoners could obtain a maximum of 100 good behaviour points per month for doing things like studying Communist Party literature, working in the prison factory or snitching on other prisoners. Once 4,200 points were accumulated, they could in theory be used to reduce prison time. If you do the maths, that would mean a prisoner would have to get maximum points every single month for three-and-half years before this could start to work. Radalj said that in reality it was used as a means of psychological torture and manipulation. He claims the guards would deliberately wait till an inmate had almost reached this goal and then penalise them on any one of a huge list of possible infractions which would cancel out points at the crucial time. These infractions included - but were not limited to - hoarding or sharing food with other prisoners, walking ""incorrectly"" in the hallway by straying from a line painted on the ground, hanging socks on a bed incorrectly, or even standing too close to the window.

Other prisoners who spoke about the points system to the BBC described it as a mind game designed to crush spirits. Former British prisoner Peter Humphrey, who spent two years in detention in Shanghai, said his facility had a similar points calculation and reduction system which was manipulated to control prisoners and block sentence reductions. ""There were cameras everywhere, even three to a cell,"" he said. ""If you crossed a line marked on the ground and were caught by a guard or on camera, you would be punished. The same if you didn't make your bed properly to military standard or didn't place your toothbrush in the right place in the cell. ""There was also group pressure on prisoners with entire cell groups punished if one prisoner did any of these things."" One ex-inmate told the BBC that in his five years in prison, he never once saw the points actually used to mitigate a sentence. Radalj said that there were a number of prisoners - including himself - who didn't bother with the points system. So authorities resorted to other means of applying psychological pressure. These included cutting time off monthly family phone calls or the reduction of other perceived benefits.

Food As Control

But the most common daily punishment involved the reduction of food. The BBC has been told by numerous former inmates that the meals at Beijing's No 2 prison were mostly made up of cabbage in dirty water which sometimes also had bits of carrot and, if they were lucky, small slivers of meat. They were also given mantou - a plain northern Chinese bread. Most of the prisoners were malnourished, Radalj added. Another prisoner described how inmates ate a lot of mantou, as they were always hungry. He said that their diets were so low in nutrition – and they could only exercise outside for half an hour each week – that they developed flimsy upper bodies but retained bloated looking stomachs from consuming so much of the mantou. Prisoners were given the opportunity to supplement their diet by buying meagre extra rations, if money from relatives had been put into what were called their ""accounts"": essentially a prison record of funds delivered to purchase provisions like soap or toothpaste. They could also use this to purchase items like instant noodles or soy milk powder. But even this ""privilege"" could be taken away. Radalj said he was blocked from making any extra purchases for 14 months because he refused to work in the prison factory, where inmates were expected to assemble basic goods for companies or compile propaganda leaflets for the ruling Communist Party.

To make things worse, they were made to work on a ""farm"", where they did manage to grow a lot of vegetables, but were never allowed to eat them. Radalj said the farm was displayed to a visiting justice minister as an example of how impressive prison life was. But, he said, it was all for show. ""We would be growing tomatoes, potatoes, cabbages and okra and then – at the end of the season – they would push it all into a big hole and bury it,"" he added. ""And if you were caught with a chilli or a cucumber in general population you would go straight to solitary confinement for eight months."" Another prisoner said they would occasionally suddenly receive protein, like a chicken leg, to make their diet look better when officials visited the prison. Humphrey said there were similar food restrictions in his Shanghai prison, adding that this led to power struggles among the inmates: ""The kitchen was run by prison labour. Those who worked there stole the best stuff and it could then be distributed."" Radalj described a battle between African and Taiwanese groups in Beijing's Prison No 2 over this issue. The Nigerian inmates were working in the kitchen and ""were getting small benefits, like a bag of apples once a month or some yogurt or a couple of bananas"", he said.

Then the Mandarin-speaking Taiwanese inmates were able to convince the guards to let them take over, giving them control of precious extra food items. This led to a large brawl, and Radalj said he was caught in the middle of it. He was sent to solitary confinement for 194 days after hitting another prisoner. Inside solitary, he finally had the lights turned off only to realise he'd be with very little light nearly all of the time, giving him the opposite sensory problem. His small food ration was also cut in half. There were no reading materials and there was nobody to talk to while he was held in a bare room of 1.2 by 1.8 metres (4ft by 6ft) for half a year. ""You start to go crazy, whether you like it or not, and that's what solitary is designed to do… So you've got to decide very quickly whether your room is really, really small, or really, really big. ""After four months, you just start talking to yourself all the time. The guards would come by and ask 'Hey, are you okay?'. And you're like, 'why?'. They replied, 'because you're laughing'."" Then, Radalj said, he would respond, in his own mind: ""It's none of your business.""

Another feature of Chinese prison life, according to Radalji, was the fake ""propaganda"" moments officials would stage for Chinese media or visiting officials to paint a rosy picture of conditions there. He said, at one point, a ""computer suite"" was set up. ""They got everyone together and told us that we'd get our own email address and that we would be able to send emails. They then filmed three Nigerian guys using these computers."" The three prisoners apparently looked confused because the computers were not actually connected to the internet - but the guards had told them to just ""pretend"". ""Everything was filmed to present a fake image of prisoners with access to computers,"" Radalj said. But, he claims, soon after the photo opportunity, the computers were wrapped up in plastic and never touched again.

The memoirs

Courtesy Matthew Radalj Radalj kept a journal in prison (pictured) detailing his time behind bars

Throughout much of the ordeal, Radalj had been secretly keeping a journal by peeling open Covid masks and writing tiny sentences inside, with the help of some North Korean prisoners, who have also since been released. ""I would be writing, and the Koreans would say: 'No smaller… smaller!'."" Radalj said many of the prisoners had no way of letting their families know they were in jail. Some had not made phone calls to their relatives because no money had been placed in their accounts for phone calls. For others, their embassies had not registered family telephone numbers for the prison phone system. Only calls to officially approved numbers worked. So, after word got round that the Australian was planning to try to smuggle his notes out, they passed on details to connect with their families. ""I had 60 or 70 people hoping I could contact their loved ones after I got out to tell them what was happening.""

He wrapped the pieces of Covid mask as tight as he could with sticky tape hoarded from the factory and tried to swallow the egg-sized bundle without the guards seeing. But he couldn't keep it down. The guards saw what was happening on camera and started asking, ""Why are you vomiting? Why do you keep gagging? What's wrong?"" So, he gave up and hid the bundle instead. When he was about to leave on 5 October 2024, he was given his old clothes which had been ripped five years earlier in the struggle over his initial arrest. There was a tear in the lining of his jacked and he quickly dropped the notes inside before a guard could see him. Radalj said he thinks someone told the prison officers of his plan because they searched his room and questioned him before he left. ""Did you forget something?"" the guards asked. ""They trashed all my belongings. I was thinking they're gonna take me back to solitary confinement. There will be new charges."" But the guard holding his clothes never knew the secret journal had been slipped inside. ""They were like, 'Get out of here!'. And it wasn't until I was on the plane, and we had already left, and the seat belt sign was switched off, that I reached into my jacket to check."" The notes were still there.

Getty Images The high-end Harry Winston jewellery store in Tokyo was burgled in November 2015

Two British men accused of robbing a luxury jewellery store in Tokyo can be sent to Japan following a landmark ruling. For almost a decade, Japanese authorities have pursued the extradition of Kaine Wright, 28, Joe Chappell, 38, and a third man over allegations they posed as customers to steal items worth £679,000 (¥106m) from a Harry Winston store. On Friday, chief magistrate Judge Goldspring rejected Wright and Chappell's challenges against extradition. Their case now passes to the home secretary to decide whether they should be sent to Japan. No extradition treaty exists between the UK and Japan, meaning it would be the first time Japan have successfully received fugitives.

Japan's initial request was rejected, but the High Court overturned the original decision following an appeal lodged by the Japanese government. In Friday's judgement - seen by the BBC - Wright, of Plumstead, and Chappell, of Belvedere, both in London, had raised concerns over prison conditions in Japan which they argued were ""arbitrary, excessive and breach international standards"". The Japanese government said the submissions were ""fundamentally flawed both legally and factually"". District Judge Goldspring, chief magistrate of England and Wales, found there was a ""prima facie case"" - enough evidence to support a charge at first glance - against Chappell and that extradition would be ""compatible"" with his and Wright's human rights.

PA Media Kaine Wright appeared at Westminster Magistrates' Court last month

Friday's ruling follows a recent High Court judgement that the Japanese government had a case to extradite Wright, Chappell and a third man named in papers as Daniel Kelly - who is Wright's father. Japan's case against Kelly will be heard at the end of this month. He has not appeared in previous extradition hearings due to a conspiracy to murder case against him taking precedence. Details from January's High Court judgement state that the Japanese ""relied upon a range of evidence"" which demonstrated that Kelly, Wright and Chappell travelled to Tokyo around the time of the jewellery raid in November 2015. CCTV captured all three arriving at Narita International Airport on 18 November 2015 and staying at ""the Elm Share House"", Japanese authorities said. Ch Insp Suzuki set out a record of the investigation to the High Court which indicated the trio ""took taxis"" to Harry Winston's branch in Omotesando Hills. In their efforts to escape, the trio left a number of items behind including an Armani jacket, he said.",,
